description: Nuxt SEO is built with full support for the I18n module.

Each module has dedicated documentation for I18n support.

## I18n Site Config

You can dynamically set the site config based on the current locale.

This is useful for setting the `url` and `name` properties based on the page the user is currently on.

See [I18n Site Config](/site-config/integrations/i18n) for more information.

## I18n Sitemap

The sitemap module will automatically generate a sitemap for each locale.

See [I18n Sitemap](/sitemap/integrations/i18n) for more information.

## I18n Robots

Any `Disallow` rules in the robots module will automatically have the locale prefixes added.

See [I18n Robots](/robots/integrations/i18n) for more information.
