Nuxt SEO is both a collection of modules and a module itself. The Nuxt SEO module is all the SEO modules combined into one that is guaranteed to work well together.

- [Nuxt Robots](/robots)
- [Nuxt Sitemap](/sitemap)
- [Nuxt OG Image](/og-image)
- [Nuxt Schema.org](/schema-org)
- [Nuxt SEO Utils](/experiments)
- [Nuxt Link Checker](/link-checker)

There is no right or wrong way to use Nuxt SEO. It's designed to be flexible and work however you need it to.

To minimise config and ensure the modules work well together, [Nuxt Site Config](/site-config) is installed automatically when using any of the modules.
