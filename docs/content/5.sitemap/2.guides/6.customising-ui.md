## Disabling the XLS

What you're looking at when you view the sitemap.xml is a XLS file, think of it just like you would a CSS file for HTML.

To view the real sitemap.xml, you can view the source of the page.
If you prefer, you can disable the XLS by setting `xsl` to `false`.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    xsl: false
  }
})
````

## Changing the columns

You can change the columns that are displayed in the sitemap by modifying the `xslColumns` option.

These have no effect on SEO and is purely for developer experience.

Note: You must always have a `URL` column at the start.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    xslColumns: [
      // URL column must always be set, no value needed
      { label: 'URL', width: '75%' },
      { label: 'Last Modified', select: 'sitemap:lastmod', width: '25%' },
    ],
  },
})
```

The `select` you provide is an XLS expression that will be evaluated against the sitemap entry.
It's recommended to prefix the value with `sitemap:` if in doubt.

### Example: Adding priority and changefreq

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    xslColumns: [
      { label: 'URL', width: '50%' },
      { label: 'Last Modified', select: 'sitemap:lastmod', width: '25%' },
      { label: 'Priority', select: 'sitemap:priority', width: '12.5%' },
      { label: 'Change Frequency', select: 'sitemap:changefreq', width: '12.5%' },
    ],
  },
})
```

## Disabling tips

In development tips are displayed on the sitemap page to help you get started.

You can disable these tips by setting the `xslTips` option to `false`.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    xslTips: false,
  },
})
```
