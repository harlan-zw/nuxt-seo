## Module Rename

With v2 the module name and scope is clarified with the rename to Nuxt SEO.

- 1.* - Nuxt SEO Kit `nuxt-seo-kit` (Nuxt Layer)
- 2.x - Nuxt SEO `@nuxtjs/seo` (Nuxt Module)

The v2 at its core allows you to use all SEO modules at runtime, prerendering is no longer required. It also
comes with improved i18n compatibility.

It has been renamed to provide a better base for growing out the Nuxt SEO ecosystem as well as to make the layer -> module
change more obvious.

::code-group

```sh [pnpm]
# remove nuxt-seo-kit
pnpm remove nuxt-seo-kit && pnpm i -D @nuxtjs/seo
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn remove nuxt-seo-kit && yarn add -D @nuxtjs/seo
```

```bash [npm]
npm remove nuxt-seo-kit && npm install -D @nuxtjs/seo
```

::

```diff [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
-  extends: ['nuxt-seo-kit'],
  modules: [
+  '@nuxtjs/seo',
  ]
})
```

## Breaking Changes

### `<SeoKit>`, `useSeoKit()` Removed

These APIs set up all the default meta and module configuration for you.

In v2, they are no longer needed as functionality has been moved to a plugin.

```diff
<template>
-  <SeoKit />
</template>
```

```diff
<script setup>
-  useSeoKit()
</script>
```

If you'd like to opt-out of the these v2 configurations, you can set [automaticDefaults](/nuxt-seo/api/config#automaticdefaults) to `false`.

## Site Config Changes

In v1, site config was set through runtime config. In v2, we have a dedicated module with helpers for handling
this config called [nuxt-site-config](/site-config/getting-started/background).

The move to a module is to allow greater flexible in changing site configuration at runtime.

If you were specifying any static config in `runtimeConfig` previously, it's now recommended to move this to the `site` key.

::code-group

```ts [v1]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    public: {
      // you can remove environment variables, they'll be set automatically
      siteUrl: process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,
      siteName: 'My App'
    }
  }
})
```

```ts [v2]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    name: 'My App'
  }
})
```

::

When updating your config:
- All keys are without the `site` prefix
- The `language` config has been renamed to `defaultLocale`

The behavior for environment variables hasn't changed, it's recommended to read [how site config works](/site-config/getting-started/how-it-works) for
more advanced configuration.

## Prerendering Changes

In v1, it was required to prerender all pages, to ensure this happened your `nuxt.config` was modified.

In v2, everything can be generated at runtime and the prerendering changes are no longer provided.

If you'd like to keep the prerendering changes, you can add this to your nuxt.config.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      crawlLinks: true,
      routes: [
        '/',
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

    runtimeBrowser: true
  }
})
