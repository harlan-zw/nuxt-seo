[Nuxt Site Config](/site-config) allows you to configure all Nuxt SEO modules at build time and runtime. Allowing you to powerfully configure
all modules at runtime, for example in a multi-tenant or i18n app.

It's recommended to set the following config:
- `url` - The canonical URL of your site, avoids duplicate content and consolidates page rank.
- `name` - The name of your site, used in the title and meta tags.
- `description` - The description of your site, used in the meta tags.
- `defaultLocale` - The default locale of your site, used in the meta tags. (you can omit this if you're using `@nuxtjs/i18n`)

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
    name: 'Awesome Site',
    description: 'Welcome to my awesome site!',
    defaultLocale: 'en', // not needed if you have @nuxtjs/i18n installed
  }
})
```

## Preview / Staging / Testing Environments

If you have non-production sites, such as staging or testing, you will need to configure these environments separately.

Learn how by reading the [Disabling Indexing](/robots/guides/disable-indexing) guide.

## Runtime Site Config

In some cases, your site config becomes a bit more complex and you will need to generate it at runtime.

Learn how to by following the [Runtime Site Config](/site-config/guides/runtime-site-config) guide.
