## Setup

1. Install `@nuxtjs/seo` dependency to your project:
```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add seo
```

2. Add it to your `modules` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtjs/seo']
})
```

## Site URL

:UBadge{color="amber" variant="solid" label="Important"}

Many of the Nuxt SEO modules will need to know what your production canonical URL is to avoid issues.

You can learn to set one by reading the [Recommended Site Config](/nuxt-seo/guides/configuring-modules) guide.

## Staging / Testing Environments

:UBadge{color="amber" variant="solid" label="Important"}

If you're using Preview / Staging / Testing environments you will need to add some additional configuration.

Learn how by reading the [Disabling Indexing](/robots/guides/disable-indexing) guide.

If you only have a production environment, you can skip this step.

## Next Steps

All modules are now installed and configured!

See the [Using the Modules](/nuxt-seo/guides/using-the-modules) guide to learn how to use them.
