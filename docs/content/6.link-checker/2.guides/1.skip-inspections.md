## Skipping Inspections

You can skip inspections by adding them to the `skipInspections` array.

For example, if you want to skip the `missing-hash` inspection, you can do so with:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  linkChecker: {
    skipInspections: [
      'missing-hash'
    ],
  },
})
```
