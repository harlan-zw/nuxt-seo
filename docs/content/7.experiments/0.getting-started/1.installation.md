1. Install `nuxt-seo-experiments` dependency to your project:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add seo-experiments
```

2. Set a Site URL

To ensure links are set up correctly, the module needs to know your site URL.

The easiest way to set a site URL is to provide it in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    // production URL
    url: 'https://example.com',
  },
})
```

Otherwise, you can use an `.env` file or environment variables.

```bash [.env]
NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

For more complex applications, learn more at the [Nuxt Site Config docs](/site-config/getting-started/how-it-works).

That's it!
