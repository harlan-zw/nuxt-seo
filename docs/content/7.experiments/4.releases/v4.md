This new stable release for Nuxt SEO experiments introduces many stability improvements and support for dark and light icons.

### Dark / Light Mode Icons

When you have a site that supports both light and dark modes, it can make sense to serve two separate icons depending on which mode is selected. With Nuxt SEO experiments you can now opt-in to this feature by simply renaming your icons as either `icon-light` or `icon-dark`.

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/icon-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
<link rel="icon" href="/icon-light.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" />
```
