1. Install `@nuxtjs/sitemap` dependency to your project:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add sitemap
```

2. Set Site Config

It's recommended to always set a canonical site URL to avoid duplicate content issues.

You can set your site URL in [many ways](/site-config/guides/setting-site-config), the easiest is `nuxt.config` or `.env`:

::code-group

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
  },
})
```

```bash [.env]
NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```
::

Sitemap URLs will have their [trailing slashes](/nuxt-seo/guides/trailing-slashes) removed by default. If you want to keep them, you can set the `trailingSlash` option to `true`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    trailingSlash: true
  },
})
```

3. Preview your Sitemap

After you've set up the module, if you visit `/sitemap.xml` you can see the generated sitemap.

This has been generated with [Application Sources](/sitemap/getting-started/data-sources).
