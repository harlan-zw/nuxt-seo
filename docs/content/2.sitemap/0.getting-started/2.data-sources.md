description: Learn how the Nuxt Sitemap sources work.
---

Every URL within your sitemap will belong to a source.

A source will either be a User source or a Application source.

## Application Sources

Application sources are sources generated automatically from your app. These are in place to make using the module more
convenient but may get in the way.

- `nuxt:pages` - Statically analysed pages of your application
- `nuxt:prerender` - URLs that were prerendered
- `nuxt:route-rules` - URLs from your route rules
- `@nuxtjs/i18n:pages` - When using the `pages` config with Nuxt I18n. See [Nuxt I18n](/sitemap/integrations/i18n) for more details.
- `@nuxt/content:document-driven` - When using Document Driven mode. See [Nuxt Content](/sitemap/integrations/content) for more details.

### Disabling application sources

You can opt out of application sources individually or all of them by using the `excludeAppSources` config.

::code-group

```ts [Disable all app sources]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    // exclude all app sources
    excludeAppSources: true,
  }
})
```

```ts [Disable pages app source]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    // exclude static pages
    excludeAppSources: ['nuxt:pages'],
  }
})
```

## User Sources

When working with a site that has dynamic routes that isn't using [prerendering discovery](/sitemap/guides/prerendering), you will need to provide your own sources.

For this, you have a few options:

## 1. Build time: provide a `urls` function

If you only need your sitemap data concurrent when you build, then providing a `urls` function is the simplest way to provide your own sources.

This function will only be run when the sitemap is generated.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    urls: async () => {
      // fetch your URLs from a database or other source
      const urls = await fetch('https://example.com/api/urls')
      return urls
    }
  }
})
```

### 2. Runtime: provide a `sources` array

If you need your sitemap data to always be up-to-date at runtime, you will need to provide your own sources explicitly.

A source is a URL that will be fetched and is expected to return an array of Sitemap URL entries.

::code-group

```ts [Single Sitemap]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    sources: [
      // create our own API endpoints
      '/api/__sitemap__/urls',
      // use a static remote file
      'https://cdn.example.com/my-urls.json',
      // hit a remote API with credentials
      ['https://api.example.com/pages/urls', { headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer <token>' } }]
    ]
  }
})
```

```ts [Multiple Sitemaps]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    sitemaps: {
      foo: {
        sources: [
          '/api/__sitemap__/urls/foo',
        ]
      },
      bar: {
        sources: [
          '/api/__sitemap__/urls/bar',
        ]
      }
    }
  }
})
```

You can provide any number of sources, however, you should consider your own caching strategy.

You can learn more about data sources on the [Dynamic URLs](/sitemap/guides/dynamic-urls) guide.
