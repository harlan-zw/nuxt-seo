## Why is my browser not rendering the XML properly?

When disabling the [XSL](/sitemap/guides/customising-ui#disabling-the-xls) (XML Stylesheet) in, the XML will
be rendered by the browser.

If you have a i18n integration, then it's likely you'll see your sitemap look raw text instead of XML.

![Broken XML because of xhtml namespace.](/sitemap/formatting-error.png)

This is a [browser bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=580033) in parsing the `xhtml` namespace which is required to add localised URLs to your sitemap.
There is no workaround besides re-enabled the XSL.

## Google Search Console shows Error when submitting my Sitemap?

Seeing "Error" when submitting a new sitemap is common. This is because Google previously
crawled your site for a sitemap and found nothing.

If your sitemap is [validating](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/validate-xml-sitemap.html) correctly, then you're all set.
It's best to way a few days and check back. In nearly all cases, the error will resolve itself.
