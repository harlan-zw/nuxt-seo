title: Sitemap Caching
description: Use the default cache engine to keep your sitemaps fast.
---

Caching your sitemap can help reduce the load on your server and improve performance.

By default, SWR caching is enabled on production environments and sitemaps will be cached for 10 minutes.

This is configured by overriding your route rules and leveraging the native Nuxt caching.

### Cache Time

You can change the cache time by setting the `cacheMaxAgeSeconds` option.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    cacheMaxAgeSeconds: 3600 // 1 hour
  }
})
```

If you want to disable caching, set the `cacheMaxAgeSeconds` to `0`.

### Cache Driver

The cache engine is set to the Nitro default of the `cache/` path.

If you want to customise the cache engine, you can set the `runtimeCacheStorage` option.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sitemap: {
    // cloudflare kv binding example
    runtimeCacheStorage: {
      driver: 'cloudflare-kv-binding',
      binding: 'OG_IMAGE_CACHE'
    }
  }
})
```
