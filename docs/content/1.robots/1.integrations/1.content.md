---

Nuxt Simple Robots integrates with Nuxt Content out of the box. Allowing you to configure if
a page should be indexable or not right from your markdown files.

## Setup

Simply use the `robots: false` frontmatter key to opt out of indexing a page.

```md [content/foo.md]
---
robots: false
---
```

This will require that your markdown files have an associated path. When using [Document Driven Mode](https://content.nuxt.com/document-driven/introduction), all markdown files will automatically
have a path set.

Otherwise, you will need to make sure your markdown files have a `path` key.

```md [content/foo.md]
---
path: /foo
robots: false
---
```

## How it works

This will add an entry to your `robots.txt` file that looks like this:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /foo
```

It will add the `X-Robots-Tag` header and `<meta name="robots">` tag to the page with the value of
[`robotsDisabledValue`](/robots/api/config#robotsdisabledvalue).
