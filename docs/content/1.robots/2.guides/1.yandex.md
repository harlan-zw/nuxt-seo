Nuxt Robots is built around first-party robots.txt specifications from Google and Bing.

Some users may want to configure Yandex, a popular search engine in Russia, and find that rules aren't working. To use
Yandex you will need to provide alternative directives.

## Clean-param

The `clean-param` directive is used to remove query parameters from URLs. This is useful for SEO as it prevents duplicate
content and consolidates page rank.

It can either be configured directly through robots.txt when targeting Yandex or through the module configuration.

### Robots.txt

To configure the `clean-param` directive in your `robots.txt` file, you can use the following syntax:

```txt
User-agent: Yandex
Clean-param: param1 param2
```

This will remove the `param1` and `param2` query parameters from URLs.

### Module Configuration

To configure the `clean-param` directive in your `nuxt.config.ts` file, you can use the following syntax:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  robots: {
    groups: [
      {
        userAgents: ['Yandex'],
        cleanParam: ['param1', 'param2']
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

## Host & Crawl-delay

These directives are deprecated and should not be used. All search engines will ignore them.
