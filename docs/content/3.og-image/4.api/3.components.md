It's recommended to use composables over components, as they are more flexible and will provide better type safety.

## `OgImage`

Render a customisable OG Image.

Uses the [defineOgImage](/og-image/api/define-og-image) composable.

```vue
<template>
    <OgImage />
</template>
```


## `OgImageScreenshot`

Takes a screenshot of the page and uses it as the image. 

Uses the [defineOgImageScreenshot](/og-image/api/define-og-image-screenshot) composable.

```vue
<template>
    <OgImageScreenshot />
</template>
```
