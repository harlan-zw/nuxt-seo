Same as [createSitePathResolver()](/site-config/api/create-site-path-resolver) but you will need to provide the request context.

## Usage

```ts [serverMiddleware.ts]
import { createSitePathResolver } from '#imports'

export default defineEventHandler((e) => {
  const resolvePath = createSitePathResolver(e, {
    canonical: true,
  })

  resolvePath('/about')
  // https://www.example.com/about
})
```
