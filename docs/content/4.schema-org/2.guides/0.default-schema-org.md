title: Default Schema.org
description: The default Schema.org setup for Nuxt Schema.org.
---

By default, a Nuxt plugin is registered in your app that will register the root nodes for a
`WebSite` and `WebPage` for you.

These are configured using [Nuxt Site Config](/site-config/getting-started/how-it-works),

## Configuring Defaults

If you'd like to change any of the data on the `WebPage` or `WebSite` nodes, you can do so by using `useSchemaOrg` in your app.

This will merge in your configuration with the default configuration.

```vue [app.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
useSchemaOrg([
  defineWebPage({
    name: 'My Page'
  }),
  defineWebSite({
    name: 'My Site'
  })
])
</script>
```

## Opt-out

If you don't want to use the default setup, you can opt-out by setting `default: false` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  schemaOrg: {
    defaults: false
  }
})
```

## Configuring Identity

Please see the [Setup Identity](/schema-org/guides/quick-setup) guide for more information on configuring your identity.
