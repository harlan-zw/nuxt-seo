## Recommendations

SSR is highly recommended for Nuxt Schema.org.

Ensure you haven't disabled SSR using `ssr: false` in your `nuxt.config`.

## Setup

1. Install `nuxt-schema-org` dependency to your project:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add schema-org
```

2. Configure your site details.

It's recommended to set a canonical site URL to avoid duplicate content issues, as well as a site name
for better default configuration.

The easiest way to add it in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  site: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
    name: 'My Website',
  }
})
```

To learn about other ways to configure your site config, head over to the [Nuxt Site Config docs](/site-config/getting-started/how-it-works).

## Next steps

That's it!

By default, the module will insert default Schema.org nodes for you, learn more about the [Default Schema.org](/schema-org/guides/default-schema-org) setup.
